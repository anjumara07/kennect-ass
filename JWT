JWT :- JSON Web Token

JWT is standard way for two parties to communicate securly , commonly used for Authentication.
Authentication takes username and password and check wheather the username and password are correct or not.
And authorization making sure that user sent the request to the server is the same user that actually logged in during the authentication process.

Benefits of JWT are :- 

1) No session to manage(stateless) : The JWT is a self contained token which has authentication information, expire time information and other user defined claims digitally signed.

2) No cookies required, so its very mobile friendly.

3) Good Performance : It reduced the network round trip time.
